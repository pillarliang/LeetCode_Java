[Back Pack II](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/backpack-ii/description)

## Description
There are `n` items and a backpack with size `m`. Given array `A` representing the size of each item and array `V` representing the value of each item.

What's the maximum value can you put into the backpack?

1. A[i], V[i], n, m are all integers.
2. You can not split an item.
3. The sum size of the items you want to put into backpack can not exceed m.
4. Each item can only be picked up once

Example1:
``` 
Input: m = 10, A = [2, 3, 5, 7], V = [1, 5, 2, 4]
Output: 9
Explanation: Put A[1] and A[3] into backpack, getting the maximum value V[1] + V[3] = 9 
```

Example2:
``` 
Input: m = 10, A = [2, 3, 8], V = [2, 5, 8]
Output: 10
Explanation: Put A[0] and A[2] into backpack, getting the maximum value V[0] + V[2] = 10 
```
